<ul>
<li>This API is designed to failover services in the case of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack.</li>

<li>The API is designed to be used to receive data on a single socket specified in the configuration and if more sockets are needed, the user will need to instantiate additional instances of the API</li>
<li>The object that the service passes to the API must include a get_data(int id, string data) method to receive information from the web where id is a reference to the connection that sent the data.</li>
<li>The object from the service must also implement the to_yaml method to convert itself into yaml </li>
<li>More information and the interface to the API can be found in the file "DDOS API Interface.pdf"</li>
