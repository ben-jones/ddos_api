  DOSR DDOS Failover API
  
  ddosApi.rb: this is a basic API to implement a failover in the case of a DDOS
    attack. This API does not implement DDOS detection per say, but examines the
    time between communications from other servers. The API essentially routes all
    traffic between the local server and other servers. More information on
    implementation details may be found throughout the code.
  contents: this file contains the DDOS_API class and all of its necessary code
  Special Note: This API is far from perfect and needs a number of changes to create
    a more effective implementation. Chief among these concerns is a need for a
    better data structure for connections of all types. I hope to address this in
    future revisions

  # backup to the fail_to connections list
  #dead_connects is a list of connections that have been marked as dead. Not used in
  # this version of the API, but my vision for the future is to use this list to 
  # add fail-over servers back into the list after they come back online
