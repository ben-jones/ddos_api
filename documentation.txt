		Documentation for DDOS_API

Inital Setup:
       In order to use the API, there are several steps that you will need to take
       
       1. Create a text file containing the sequence of servers to failover to. The
       	  file should be formatted as "ip# port#\n" with the ip address replacing ip#
	  and the port number replacing port#
       
       2. Inside your program run the method config_api("filename.txt") with
          "filename.txt" replaced with the name of your text file. 
	  Note: If you want to know where the failover is set to be sent to, it
	  	is helpful to realize that every statement returns a value and
		config_api returns an array with the port and ip of the connection.
		The method get_failover_connection will also return the info.
